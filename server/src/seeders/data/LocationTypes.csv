58,BEACH Program Site-Channelized stream,"The process of straightening or redirecting natural streams in an artificially modified or constructed stream bed. Channelization has been carried out for numerous reasons, most often to drain wetlands , direct water flow for agricultural use, and control flooding . While this process makes a stream more useful for human activities, it tends to interfere with natural river habitats and to destabilize stream banks by destroying riparian vegetation."
59,BEACH Program Site-Estuary,"a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments.  The sea water entering the estuary is diluted by the fresh water flowing from rivers and streams. "

1,Canal Drainage," As a channel drainage system it is designed to eliminate the need for further pipework systems to be installed in parallel to the drainage, reducing the environmental impact of production as well as improving water collection."
2,Canal Irrigation,"Irrigation canals are the main waterways that bring irrigation water from a water source to the areas to be irrigated. They can be lined with concrete, brick, stone, or a flexible membrane to prevent seepage and erosion."
3,Canal Transport,"Canals are human-made channels for water conveyance, or to service water transport vehicles. In most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as slack water levels, often just called levels."
10,Channelized Stream,"The process of straightening or redirecting natural streams in an artificially modified or constructed stream bed. Channelization has been carried out for numerous reasons, most often to drain wetlands , direct water flow for agricultural use, and control flooding . While this process makes a stream more useful for human activities, it tends to interfere with natural river habitats and to destabilize stream banks by destroying riparian vegetation."
12,Constructed Wetland,"A constructed wetland (CW) is an artificial wetland to treat municipal or industrial wastewater, greywater or stormwater runoff. It may also be designed for land reclamation after mining, or as a mitigation step for natural areas lost to land development.Constructed wetlands are engineered systems that use natural functions vegetation, soil, and organisms to treat wastewater"
13,Estuary,"a partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea Estuaries form a transition zone between river environments and maritime environments.  The sea water entering the estuary is diluted by the fresh water flowing from rivers and streams. "
73,Floodwater non-Urban,"A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry  Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries"
72,Floodwater Urban,"A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry  In the sense of ""urban runoff water"". it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood."
