        '<p>This project is focused on harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Fox Pond. HABs have become increasingly common since 2004, typically lasting approximately one to two months in late summer. </p><p>When HABs occur, humans cannot use the pond due to the presence of toxic microcystins. This restricts recreation during summer – the busiest time of the year – and represents a financial loss to the businesses and town. There are also concerns that small children or pets will ingest pond water during a HAB and become ill.</p><p>In addition, the HABs threaten the ecological balance of Fox Pond. There have been at least seven fish kills since the HABs began in 2004, and it is possible that small mammals that drink pond water or eat fish from the pond could become ill from microcystins. The HABs also compromise downstream water quality, particularly in terms of dissolved oxygen.</p>',

        '<p>Fox Pond is located in Somerset, MA, and is hydrologically connected to the Saddle River. It is a popular recreation site for swimming, boating, and fishing thanks to a small public beach located on its southern shore. The Somerset Department of Recreation organizes a youth swim team at the lake every summer, and a small company rents kayaks year-round. Visitors can walk to a few nearby businesses that sell lunch and ice cream. During the summer, approximately 250 people visit the public beach on the southern end of Fox Pond each day, and the pond remains a popular attraction even in the colder months.</p><p> In addition to being a recreational and economic asset for the people of Somerset, Fox Pond is an important wildlife area. Volunteers from the local chapter of the Audubon Society have recorded over 45 bird species, including some federally threatened and endangered species, stopping at the pond during the fall migration. The pond is home to fish and aquatic invertebrates, and mammals such as red-tailed foxes, muskrat, and black bear have been sighted. Volunteers routinely remove Japanese knotweed (<i>Fallopia japonica</i>) from the pond perimeter, but the pond does not have other significant invasive species concerns. Fox Pond is connected to a number of local streams, including the Saddle River, which was recently daylighted as part of a restoration project.</p><p> Since 2004, harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become increasingly common in Fox Pond. The HABs typically last approximately one to two months in late summer. The Friends of Fox Pond hypothesize that the incidence of HABs is related to land use changes in the watershed that have led to more impervious surfaces and increased fertilizer use on residential landscapes. Residential development and conversion of summer cabins to year-round residences on the pond and the Fox Pond watershed have increased substantially in the past 20 years. In 2007, a 300-home development was constructed in the watershed. State agency staff monitoring local streams have reported increased turbidity and lower dissolved oxygen following the completion of this development, and the Board of Health’s weekly beach monitoring data indicate higher <i>E. coli</i> concentrations.</p>',

        <p><strong>Representativeness</strong></p>
        <p>Sampling locations and survey times were selected to ensure that the samples taken represent typical field conditions at the time and location of sampling. Stations to evaluate site-specific impacts of illicit connections or stormwater discharges were selected to determine representativeness of distinct conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Comparability</strong></p>
        <p>Standardized sampling and analytical methods, units of reporting, and site selection procedures will be used to ensure comparability of data with others using those same methods. Sample time and date of collection, sample storage and transfer, as well as laboratories and identification specialists used will be documented so that future surveys can produce comparable data by following similar procedures.</p>
